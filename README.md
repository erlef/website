## Creating blog posts

The eef.gen.post mix task should be used to create new blog posts. The command structure is as follows:

`mix eef.gen.post <working-group> <slug>`

The current options are available:

- `--author <string>` or  `-a <string>`
- `--title    <string> ` or `-t <string>`

Note that you may edit the author, title, and other meta data after the post is generated.

```shell
mix eef.gen.post education missing-rug --author "The Dude" --title "It tied the room together"
* creating priv/posts/education/20190708231334_missing-rug.md
```
Now you may open up the created file and edit the metadata and author the content of your post with your favorite editor.
