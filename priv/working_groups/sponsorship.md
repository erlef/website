Sponsorships help the Erlang Ecosystem worldwide by supporting sprints, meetups, community events and projects,

Erlang Ecosystem community and Erlang Ecosystem tools that are used daily. This work can’t be done without the generous 
financial support that sponsor organizations provide to the foundation.
