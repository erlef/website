## Mission Statement
Facilitate, evolve education and training and consolidate educational material(s) for all BEAM languages and the BEAM itself.

## Benefits to the community
- Make an analysis of the gaps in the current state of the field so we can identify how to best help the community.
- Create a plan and present it to the board so they can allocate resources whenever necessary.

## Short term deliverables
- Make an analysis of the gaps in the current state of the field so we can identify how to best help the community.
- Create a plan and present it to the board so they can allocate resources whenever necessary.

## Long term deliverables
- Help grow the community by providing ramp-up materials and training to fill the gaps that have been identified.
- Coordination work with different organizations both commercial and non-profit to foster support for BEAM technologies. Some examples are bridges, conferences, meetups & user groups.
- Provide educational resources for corporate decision-makers who are researching Ecosystem technologies

## Why does this group require the Foundation
- A point of organization, resources, influence, and provision of funds for training and educational purposes.
