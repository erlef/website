mail addresses and group chat.

- SSL certificates

## Why does this group require the Foundation
The Infra-WG provides services to approved Erlang Ecosystem Foundation  Working Groups (WGs),
Erlang community groups, and organizations recognized by the Board of Directors (Board) as
being critical to the success of the mission of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.
