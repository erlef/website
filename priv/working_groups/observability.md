## Mission Statement
Evolve the tools in the ecosystem related to observability, such as metrics, distributed tracing and logging, with a strong focus on interoperability between BEAM languages.

## Main Objectives
- Improved runtime observability through integration with modern offerings -- Zipkin, Jaeger, DataDog, Prometheus, Honeycomb, LightStep, Stackdriver and many more -- without vendor lock in.
- Improve state of whitebox monitoring of BEAM applications
- Review possibilities to improve blackbox monitoring of BEAM (dtrace, eBPF)
- Provide common interfaces to viewing and gathering VM and application statistics and traces
- Cooperation with major OAM providers like New Relic to provide proper commercial support for Erlang monitoring


## Benefits to the community
- Provide tooling that will allow more integrated and application-wide monitoring, logging, and tracing in BEAM
- BEAM integrating smoothly with other languages and services
- Consolidate efforts across languages and combine tools
- Encourage and assist library developers to make things observable
- Encourage and make it easier for application developers to make their systems observable
- Make it easier for users of the virtual machine to integrate it in polyglot environments where existing monitoring systems are already in place, and where lack of support is a blocker to adoption


## Short term deliverables
- Living document for current best practices for observability with a blog post on a prominent Erlang site like Erlang Solutions or the Foundation website to go along with it
- Standard Logger/logger infrastructure to collect structured logs (logs, error reports and stacktraces) from both Erlang and Elixir.
- Support for metrics and traces of popular Erlang and Elixir libraries (Hackney, Ecto, Phoenix, etc) through Telemetry and OpenCensus.
- Support for HTTP and binary context propagation for distributed tracing in popular Erlang and Elixir libraries.


## Long term deliverables
- Helping library authors add standard instrumentation hooks (e.g. Telemetry or potentially even OpenCensus as it becomes more of a standard)

## Why does this group require the Foundation
- Promotion: Being a central group for user’s to find information on instrumenting and observing BEAM systems and promoting solutions to the community through the Foundation.
- Coordination of work across languages and libraries. Bringing together the work as a central place to bring suggestions and PRs to the OTP team.
