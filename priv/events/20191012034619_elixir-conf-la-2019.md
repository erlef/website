Elixir Conf LATAM 2019
---
Elixir Conf is one of the most popular Conferences for the Elixir Programming Language and for the first time it will be hosted in Latin America, Medellin, Colombia. It is a two day conference with workshops and a amazing list of keynote speakers with very interesting topics. Thanks to all of our sponsors, speakers and attendees that are making this event possible.

The first conference day will start with a two hands-on workshops where we will learn about functional programming and how to get the most out of Erlang/OTP with RIAK Core. On the second day, keynote speakers will have the floor to share their knowledge on a variety of topics for a diverse audience; closing up with Francesco Cessarini's keynote.
