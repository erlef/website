The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF) Security Working Group is committed to enhancing the security of the BEAM community. In an era where cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated, we are proactively addressing security challenges to ensure that applications built on Erlang, Elixir, and other BEAM languages remain robust and reliable.

**Our Commitment to Security**

We have recently updated our key resources to provide the most current and practical guidance for developers and organizations:

- **[Secure Coding and Deployment Hardening Guidelines](https://erlef.github.io/security-wg/secure_coding_and_deployment_hardening/):** This comprehensive guide covers best practices for writing secure code and hardening deployments specific to the BEAM ecosystem. It addresses common vulnerabilities and offers strategies to mitigate them effectively.

- **[Web Application Security Best Practices for BEAM Languages](https://erlef.github.io/security-wg/web_app_security_best_practices_beam/):** Tailored for web developers, this resource delves into security considerations unique to web applications running on the BEAM, helping you build applications that are secure by design.

We believe that security is a collective responsibility. By following these guidelines, developers can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in their applications, contributing to a safer digital environment for all users.

**For Developers**

We encourage all BEAM developers to familiarize themselves with these resources. Implementing the recommended practices not only strengthens your applications but also enhances your professional expertise in secure codingâ€”a vital skill in today's technology landscape.

**For Organizations and Management**

For businesses leveraging the BEAM ecosystem, these resources demonstrate our dedication to maintaining high security standards. Adopting our guidelines can help safeguard your applications against potential threats, ensuring business continuity and protecting your reputation.

**Complementary Resources**

While our focus is on BEAM-specific security practices, we acknowledge the importance of understanding broader security principles. Organizations like [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/) offer valuable resources on general cybersecurity topics that can complement our guides.

**Join Us in Building a Secure Future**

Security is an ongoing journey, and we invite you to join us in this crucial endeavor. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and together let's continue to build secure and reliable applications within the BEAM ecosystem.
