## Leveraging Erlang for Enhanced Fault Tolerance and Productivity in Space Applications: Insights from the GRiSP Platform

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (**EEF**) is excited to announce that Peer Stritzinger, a board member of the EEF,
will be presenting at the Flight Software Workshop 2024. His talk,
[Leveraging Erlang for Enhanced Fault Tolerance and Productivity in Space Applications: Insights from the GRiSP Platform](https://flightsoftware.org/workshop/FSW2024)
will illuminate how Erlang’s fault-tolerant, distributed programming features and the Real-Time Executive for
Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS) come together through the GRiSP platform to tackle the unique challenges of space
software development.

In this talk, Stritzinger will delve into Erlang’s unparalleled strengths in
building resilient systems that automatically recover from failures,
essential for space's unpredictable environments. Erlang's lightweight
processes and message-passing model enhance distributed systems' scalability
and maintainability, allowing for efficient development of complex
communication protocols and consistent performance across distributed space systems.

The GRiSP platform combines Erlang's high-level fault-tolerant programming with RTEMS,
a reliable real-time operating system. This integration creates an environment that enhances
productivity and simplifies system management. Stritzinger will highlight the synergy between
the GRiSP platform and RTEMS, showcasing how their collaboration fosters resilient, scalable
embedded systems for both ground and space.

He will also introduce the GRiSP2 evaluation board and the upcoming GRiSP nano,
which offer developers streamlined prototyping and deployment tools, crucial for
efficient IoT system development.

Join Peer Stritzinger at the Flight Software Workshop 2024 to discover how the
Erlang language and GRiSP platform offer a robust, productive toolkit for
overcoming space application challenges.
