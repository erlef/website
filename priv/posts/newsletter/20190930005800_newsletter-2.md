## Working Group Water Cooler
------------------------------------------------------------

Name and Role in the Working Group
Desmond Bowe. I lead the Marketing Working Group.

What is the primary goal of the working group? Describe in reference to the community benefits.
The Marketing group is responsible for promoting community and Foundation activities.  Our audience is both internal and external- we communicate to the Ecosystem itself, and also to the wider tech industry about the benefits of the platform.  Our goals are to support community organizers

How does the group determine what to focus on? Is there a way for the community to collaborate?
At every meeting we ask ourselves how we can expand and support the community.  This year has been spent largely on developing the infrastructure for the Foundation - hosting the website, creating the membership workflow, setting up the mailing list. Those tasks are (mostly) behind us, so the next big piece is to centralize community resources and, as much as possible, facilitate communication.  We're not trying to take over the excellent work that's been done on the Slack channels, Meetups, conferences, etc.  We just want to make sure that folks aren't operating in silos, and that the community isn't duplicating efforts.  How can you help? Send us ideas!  Especially if you're an organizer of a Meetup, conference, etc, or would like to be.  And we always need help with our website!

What is the group currently focused on? Are there initiatives planned?
We'd like to highlight work done by individuals in the community. Significant contributions to open-source is what keeps technologies rolling and we want to recognize the efforts that so many have put in.  We're also exploring a way to get Elixir developers more involved in OTP/BEAM development.  Get in touch if you're interested :).

Have long term initiatives been discussed? Describe based on priority and benefit.
We would like to publish case studies and white papers to inform decision-makers about the benefits of the the Ecosystem.  Too often managers reach for the JVM or CLR without even considering the BEAM.  We'd like to change that.

How can the community help in supporting the group? Are there projects that need contributes or collaborators?
[Our website!](https://github.com/erlef/website).

What is the best way for the community to stay informed on the working group's initiatives?
Follow us on twitter!  We run the twitter account, so you'll hear about our activities there first. We also keep an open list of ongoing work on our [github page](https://github.com/erlef/marketing).


## Sponsor Testimonial - Why Do We Care?
------------------------------------------------------------

We invest deeply and depend heavily on the open-source libraries and tools that power up our infrastructure. Maintaining and improving those projects is a big challenge for their contributors, with many of them not being backed up by any company big or small. We believe that the EEF can help on the area a lot.
