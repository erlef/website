The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has joined the CVE® Program as a CNA, making it
easier for the BEAM community to disclose and track vulnerabilities in Hex.pm
packages and core ecosystem projects.
---

The [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation CNA](https://cna.erlef.org/) has officially
joined the [CVE® Program](https://www.cve.org/) as an authorized
CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). This designation allows us to assign CVE IDs to
publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities within our defined scope,
helping to improve security and transparency in the broader open-source
community.

## What is a CVE?
CVE stands for *Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*. It's a global system for
identifying and cataloging publicly known security issues in software. Each CVE
ID is a unique identifier that makes it easier to talk about and fix
vulnerabilities. Being part of this program means we can help track and
coordinate security issues across the BEAM ecosystem in a standard, globally
recognized way.

## Scope of Coverage

Our CNA is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to:

- All **active packages hosted on [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/)**, *provided no more
  specific CNA exists for that package.*
- All active projects hosted under the following GitHub organizations:
  - [@elixir-lang](https://github.com/elixir-lang)
  - [@erlang](https://github.com/erlang)
  - [@erlef-cna](https://github.com/erlef-cna)
  - [@erlef](https://github.com/erlef)
  - [@gleam-lang](https://github.com/gleam-lang)
  - [@hexpm](https://github.com/hexpm)

You can always check if a package is covered by a more specific CNA via the
[List of CVE Partners](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners).

## A Community Collaboration

This CNA is the result of a collaborative effort between the **Erlang/OTP**,
**Erlang Ecosystem Foundation**, **Elixir**, **Gleam**, and **Hex** communities.
Together, we are committed to supporting secure development practices across our
shared ecosystem.

## What’s Changing for Me?

With the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation now acting as a CNA, here’s what this means
for different members of our community:

- **Project Maintainers:** You can now request CVE IDs directly from us instead
  of going through MITRE. We also offer guidance and support throughout the
  disclosure process.
- **Security Reporters:** Submit vulnerability reports to us instead of MITRE.
  We’ll help facilitate communication with project maintainers and guide the
  process responsibly.
- **Tool Developers:** Expect more accurate, consistent, and ecosystem-specific
  CVE metadata, enabling improved security tooling and automation.
- **Ecosystem Users:** Over time, this will lead to better tooling support and
  increased visibility into the security posture of the packages you rely on.

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

If you are a project maintainer within our scope and need to request a CVE ID,
please reach out to **us directly** rather than contacting MITRE as you may have
done previously. As your CNA, we are here to guide you through the process. This
change replaces the default reporting path via MITRE for projects covered by our
CNA.

We offer dedicated **support for responsible vulnerability disclosure**—including
coordination and best practices—for all maintainers of projects covered by our
scope. Whether you're unsure how to handle a report or need help with wording a
disclosure, we’re here to assist.

For reporters: we strongly encourage you to follow the **Security Policy** of
the affected project when disclosing vulnerabilities. These can usually be found
in the project’s repository or package metadata.

If you're unable to reach the project team, or are unsure how to proceed, you’re
welcome to contact us us directly via [our contact page](https://cna.erlef.org/contact).


## About the CVE® Program

The CVE® Program is a global initiative to identify, define, and catalog
publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. It enables organizations and
individuals to speak a common language about security issues and coordinate
their responses more effectively.

The CVE List is built and maintained by CNAs (CVE Numbering Authorities) around
the world. Each CNA is authorized to assign CVE IDs and publish records for
vulnerabilities within their scope. These records help ensure consistent tracking
and communication of security issues and feed into databases like the U.S.
National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

For more information, visit [cve.org](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview).

## Join Us in Making the Ecosystem Safer

As a community-driven CNA, we aim to support developers, security researchers,
and users in the Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam ecosystems. We are committed to
responsible vulnerability disclosure and improving the overall security posture
of open-source software.
