EEF 2025 Board Election Results

## 2025 Board Election Results

Over the last month, the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation [has been running elections for its Cohort `B`](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2025). We're thankful for everyone who [decided to get involved by running](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2025-candidates#who-are-the-current-candidates), and those who made their voices heard by voting.

Quorum was reached in the election and cohort `C` contains the following three members :

- Lars Wikman
- Lee Barney
- Zach Daniel

The board wishes to thank Powell Kinney, Peter Ullrich, and Jim Freeze for participating in the election this year and and looks forward to them running in 2026.

The change will be officiated during the next board meeting, where we'll transfer the powers between the old board
members to the new ones through a final procedural vote. Thanks again to everyone who participated in this election!

Next year's election will be based on cohort `A`, which includes Sebastian Strollo, Amos King, Alistair Woodman, and Franceso Cesarini and will represent yet another opportunity to get involved in the BEAM ecosystem.
