## EEF 2024 Vote Election results

Over the last month, the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation [has been running elections for its Cohort `B`](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2024). We're thankful for everyone who [decided to get involved by running](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2024#who-are-the-current-candidates), and those who made their voices heard by voting.

Cohort `B` contains four members, who now are:

- Miriam Pena (62 votes)
- Peer Stritzinger (56 votes)
- Kiko Fernandez-Reyes (53 votes)
- Bryan Paxton (51 votes)

The fifth position went to David Bernheisel with 22 votes.
Miriam, Peer, and Bryan are returning board members, and Kiko Fernandez-Reyes will therefore replace Sophie DeBenedetto, whom we
thank for her role as a board member.

The change will be officialized during the next board meeting, where we'll transfer the powers between the old board
members to the new ones through a final procedural vote. Thanks again to everyone who participated in this election!

Next year's election will be based on cohort `C`, which includes Maxim Fedorov, Kenneth Lundin, and Ben Marx and will represent yet another opportunity to get involved in the BEAM ecosystem.
