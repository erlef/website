EEF 2024 Board Election

## About the election

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is set up as a community organisation, to be run for and by the community. As such, the role of board member is assigned by a democratic process, where voting members get to run and vote for their preferred candidates.

The process to be followed is described in legalese in our bylaws, but this page will explain more clearly how we plan for this to be working forwards.

## Important Dates

The following dates are important to the campaign:
- March 29th: Elections announced 
- April 5th: Members can submit their candidacy
- April 19th: Last day to submit your candidacy and email acceptance ends at 23:59 UTC
- April 20th: Votes are open at 00:00 UTC
- April 27th: Votes are closed at 23:59 UTC

Election results will be announced as soon as possible after closing.

Do not forget to make sure you are a [voting member](#how-to-vote) to take part into the elections.

## What Does a Board Member do?

Board members' main involvement is essentially to [sit in meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3dnc6jIQ2ZdT3dC3Gjgjx1DQXR0GE9J) (usually over video chat), and vote on the direction the foundation will take. They are responsible for things such as:

- Choosing how to allocate the budget of the Foundation (within the regulations specified by the bylaws and the IRS)
- Choosing which working groups are going to be accepted
- Choosing which working groups may be contracted if they are not meeting their objectives
- Handling administrative details (such as running these elections)
- Helping coordinate efforts across working groups
- Have the ability to change and adjust bylaws
- Bear the responsibility and be accountable for the Foundation's ongoing success

It is ultimately a fairly political job focused on "running the foundation", distinct from the more direct involvement people in specific working groups usually have. Board members are not precluded from being part of working groups either.

Additionally, the roles of Director and Secretary can only be assigned to people on the board; they are the people who have all the actual administrative duties related to legal paperwork (writing actual signatures!), finance, insurance, maintaining meeting minutes, and ensuring that bylaws are respected by the rest of the board.

None of these roles are compensated; this is a volunteer effort because you care to steer the foundation in a direction you believe is important. You may also put the role of board member on your LinkedIn page or resume if that suits you.

## Who are the Outgoing Board Members?

While the founding members assigned themselves to be part of the board as part of the initial bootstrapping effort, the board has been randomly divided into three cohorts, `A` (containing 3 members), `B` (4 members), and `C` (4 members). To ensure continuity, only one cohort is re-elected each year. This means that you will be elected for 3 years at a time.

Here are the cohorts as defined until the next election:

<ul>
    <li><code class="inline">A</code>, to be re-elected in 2026, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>Sebastian Strollo (current Secretary)</li>
            <li>Amos King</li>
            <li>Alistair Woodman (current President)</li>
            <li>Francesco Cesarini</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code class="inline">B</code>, to be re-elected in 2024, 2027, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>Miriam Pena</li>
            <li>Peer Stritzinger</li>
            <li>Sophie DeBenedetto</li>
            <li>Bryan Paxton</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code class="inline">C</code>, to be re-elected in 2025, 2028, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>Maxim Fedorov</li>
            <li>Kenneth Lundin</li>
            <li>Ben Marx</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

For this years election, the members of cohort `B` are to be re-elected, so the seats of Bryan, Miriam, Peer, and Peer are up for grabs.

On that day, a link will be sent to you to the address defined [in your member profile](https://members.erlef.org/Sys/Profile). The link will forward you to a form, which will contain a list of all the candidates. Since three chairs are up for re-election, you will get to pick 3 candidates.

<br/>

Kiko Fernandez-Reyes is member of the OTP team and holds a PhD in Computer Science by Uppsala University, Sweden. His PhD work has received multiple awards (2 Best Paper Awards and 2 Distinguished Artifact Awards) for the technical contributions, documentation, and source code (reproducibility). After his PhD, he worked at Klarna writing services in Haskell and Erlang, and he was a Board Member of the (Typed) Functional community in Klarna. Later on, he moved to Ericsson and tries to improve OTP little by little.

### Why vote for him?

I have a mixed background between academia and industry. As part of the OTP team, I can act as a bridge between the OTP team and the EEF board as well as working groups. My academic background and connections can bring academics to help us get more innovation for BEAM languages. Innovation can come in several ways, for example, researchers/academic partners looking for more optimised garbage collection algorithms, improvements to success typing theory and practice, improvements to the JIT, or even a more energy efficient virtual machine. All of these things have an impact on all BEAM languages, and the OTP team cannot always do "blind" research on all of these topics. We are as strong as our community.

_outgoing board member_

<br/>

Bryan (a.k.a starbelly) has worked on the BEAM for roughly 8 years at companies utilizing Elixir, but sought to embed himself within the Erlang community at large (LFE, Gleam, etc.). He has a strong sense of community, has a passion for helping people, and chances are he has reached out to try and help you in the past. In his spare time he contributes to Erlang/OTP, Elixir, hex\_core, hexpm, rebar3, and is a co-maintainer of setup-beam, verl, rebar3\_ex\_doc and rebar3\_hex. He also has been an active contributor within the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation shortly after its inception.

### Why vote for him?

As an annual supporting member, an active contributor, and a member of several BEAM communities; I have a vested interest in helping further the foundation's goals and by extension the ecosystem. I bet the farm on the BEAM and as such I make it a point to be highly involved wherever and however I can to assist in furthering the success of the entire community and ecosystem.
