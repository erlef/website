The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is set up as a community organisation, to be run for and by the community. As such, the role of board member is assigned by a democratic process, where voting members get to run and vote for their preferred candidates.

The process to be followed is described in legalese in our bylaws, but this page will explain more clearly how we plan for this to be working forwards.

## Important Dates

The following dates are important to the campaign:

- February 26: Elections announced, people can submit their candidacy
- March 11: Last day to submit your candidacy. Email acceptance ends at midnight PT on the 12th
- March 12: Votes are open
- March 19: Votes are closed

Election results will be announced as soon as possible after closing.

Do not forget to make sure you are a [voting member](#how-to-vote) to take part into the elections.

## What Does a Board Member do?

Board members' main involvement is essentially to [sit in meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3dnc6jIQ2ZdT3dC3Gjgjx1DQXR0GE9J) (usually over video chat), and vote on the direction the foundation will take. They are responsible for things such as:

- Choosing how to allocate the budget of the Foundation (within the regulations specified by the bylaws and the IRS)
- Choosing which working groups are going to be accepted
- Choosing which working groups may be contracted if they are not meeting their objectives
- Handling administrative details (such as running these elections)
- Helping coordinate efforts across working groups
- Have the ability to change and adjust bylaws
- Bear the responsibility and be accountable for the Foundation's ongoing success

It is ultimately a fairly political job focused on "running the foundation", distinct from the more direct involvement people in specific working groups usually have. Board members are not precluded from being part of working groups either.

Additionally, the roles of Director and Secretary can only be assigned to people on the board; they are the people who have all the actual administrative duties related to legal paperwork (writing actual signatures!), finance, insurance, maintaining meeting minutes, and ensuring that bylaws are respected by the rest of the board.

None of these roles are compensated; this is a volunteer effort because you care to steer the foundation in a direction you believe is important. You may also put the role of board member on your LinkedIn page or resume if that suits you.

## Who are the Outgoing Board Members?

While the founding members assigned themselves to be part of the board as part of the initial bootstrapping effort, the board has been randomly divided into three cohorts, `A` (containing 3 members), `B` (4 members), and `C` (4 members). To ensure continuity, only one cohort is re-elected each year. This means that you will be elected for 3 years at a time.

Here are the cohorts as defined until the next election:

<ul>
    <li><code class="inline">A</code>, to be re-elected in 2022, 2025, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>José Valim</li>
            <li>Richard Carlsson</li>
            <li>Kenneth Lundin</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code class="inline">B</code>, to be re-elected in 2021, 2024, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>Peer Stritzinger</li>
            <li>Maxim Fedorov</li>
            <li>Benoit Chesneau</li>
            <li>Miriam Pena</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><code class="inline">C</code>, to be re-elected in 2023, 2026, and every three years after:
        <ul>
            <li>Sebastian Strollo (current Secretary)</li>
            <li>Fred Hebert</li>
            <li>Alistair Woodman (current President)</li>
            <li>Francesco Cesarini</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

For this first election, the members of cohort `B` are to be re-elected, so the seats of Peer, Maxim, Benoit, and Miriam are up for grabs.

Furthermore, José Valim is going to be stepping down from his seat on Cohort A in order to have more time to focus on working groups, namely the newly founded ML working group he will chair, and will remain active within the foundation. Whoever runs for the board and gets the fifth most votes in the election will be able to serve the remainder of José's term, and be re-elected in 2022.

We therefore need 5 people to fill in the seats this year!

<h3 id="erik-stenman">Erik (Happi) Stenman</h3>

<img src="/images/volunteers/erik-stenman.jpg" width="175" height="175" alt="candidate photo" />

_first time candidate_

Erik, or Happi as most people call him, has been programming Erlang since 1994; as a master's student, as a doctoral student in the HiPE research group at Uppsala University, as a CSO and CTO at Klarna and now as CEO of Happi Hacking. Erik started programming in 1980 and started his first company in 1989.

Erik wrote the world's first native code compiler for Erlang, called Jerico, and also initiated and wrote the first version of the second native code compiler for Erlang, HiPE.

In addition to this, Erik has also written "The BEAM book" and articles about Erlang, presented his research at several academic conferences and workshops, and was awarded the "Erlang User of the Year" during his time in the HiPE research group.

He was also project leader for the group that developed the first version of Scala, as well as university lecturer, especially in compiler technology.

Erik was together with Joe Armstrong one of the driving forces behind the Erlang Enhancement Process (EEP). He also was a long time member of the board of the Erlang Industrial User group, the precursor to the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.

### Why vote for him?

I think you should vote for me as a member of the board since I still have a passion for Erlang and the Beam, even after over 25 years. I still want to learn more about Erlang and I want more people to know about the Erlang Ecosystem. If you want someone with pretty deep technical knowledge of the BEAM and not so much interest in politics you should vote for me.

<h3 id="maxim-fedorov">Maxim Fedorov</h3>

<img src="/images/members/maxim-fedorov.jpg" width="175" height="175" alt="member photo" />

_outgoing board member_

Maxim has over 18 years of experience in networking, security and
scalability. He discovered the BEAM ecosystem when he joined WhatsApp,
and soon became a passionate community supporter. Maxim is an engineer
to the core. Author and maintainer of several open source libraries:
argparse, erlperf, power\_shell. Active contributor to OTP, featuring
highlights to R23 with pg, and concurrent TLS distribution handshake
in R24. Member of Build and Packaging working Group, improving Rebar3
support for large codebases.

Maxim believes in an open community with members pursuing a goal of
growing the successful ecosystem.

### Why vote for him?

Two years ago we were just a group of enthusiastic people, willing to
bring fragmented communities together. We had a dream of building a
strong foundation. I volunteered to be one of the founding members of
the Marketing working group, and created the original erlef.org
website in just a week before the official announcement.

Ecosystem growth is still my focus. Supporting foundation members with
necessary infrastructure is one of the key components. I promise to do
my best to provide this support, now as a member of the Infrastructure
working group.

I believe that our mission is to bring companies and individuals to
work together towards a single goal—ecosystem success. That’s why I
am a BEAM ambassador at WhatsApp, willing to drive company engagement
in the ecosystem, and work to improve the community.

<h3 id="bryan-paxton">Bryan Paxton</h3>

<img src="/images/volunteers/bryan-paxton.jpg" width="175" height="175" alt="member photo" />

_first time candidate_

Bryan (a.k.a starbelly) has worked on the BEAM for roughly 5 years at companies utilizing Elixir, but sought to embed himself within the Erlang community fairly early on, and recently the LFE community as well. He has a strong sense of community, has a passion for helping people, and chances are he has reached out to try and help you in the past. In his spare time he contributes to Erlang/OTP, Elixir, hex\_core, hexpm, rebar3, and is a co-maintainer of rebar3\_hex. He also has been an active contributor within the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation shortly after its inception.

### Why vote for him?

I bet the farm on the BEAM...

As an annual supporting member, an active contributor, and a member of several BEAM communities; I have a vested interest in helping further the foundation's goals and by extension the ecosystem. I bet the farm on the BEAM and as such I make it a point to be highly involved wherever I can to assist however I can in furthering the success of the entire community and ecosystem.

For the past two years I have:

- Helped implement the elixir version of erlef.org, as well as continue to develop and maintain it.
- Setup internal and external infrastructure for the foundation and the community.
- General administrative and operative duties.
- Onboarding of working groups and contributors.
- Assisted in marketing the foundation.

In addition, and perhaps most importantly, I've earnestly made some great friends over these past few years and I plan to build and grow that in order to serve as an effective board member.

Some things I wish to accomplish over the next 3 years:

 - Help streamline the board's meeting and voting process to speed up the turn-around time so that we may be more efficient in our efforts to support the ecosystem.
 - Help devise and implement a bounty program for the community.
 - Work closely with working groups and the community at large to convey and support the needs of both.
