The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation has [held its elections over the last month](https://erlef.org/news/eef/election-2020), and what a wild month it's been for all of us. Despite global events, roughly 63% of our members with the right to vote came forward and elected a new board.

We want to thank [everyone who decided to run](https://erlef.org/news/eef/election-2020#who-are-the-current-candidates); it's been a rather close result for votes. However, in the end the following members remain part of the board:

- Francesco Cesarini
- Fred Hebert
- Sebastian Strollo
- Alistair Woodman

They will keep representing cohort `C`, which will be electable again in 2023.

Next year's election will be based on cohort `B`, currently including Peer Stritzinger, Maxim Fedorov, Benoit Chesneau, and Miriam Pena.

Thanks to everyone who participated in this election.
