EEF 2023 Re-Vote Election results
---

Over the last month, the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation [has been running elections for its Cohort `A`](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2023-revote). We're thankful for everyone who [decided to get involved by running](https://erlef.org/blog/eef/election-2023-revote#who-are-the-current-candidates), and those who made their voices heard by voting.

Cohort `A` contains four members, who now are:

- Francesco Cesarini (65 votes)
- Sebastian Strollo (49 votes)
- Alistair Woodman (49 votes)
- Amos King (44 votes)

The fifth position went to Kiko Fernandez-Reyes, with 36 votes, and the 6th position to Thomas Depierre with 28 votes.
Francesco, Sebastian, and Alistair are returning board members, and Amos King will therefore replace Fred Hebert, who we
thank for his role as a founding board member.

The change will be officialized during the next board meeting, where we'll transfer the powers between the old board
members to the new ones through a final procedural vote. Thanks again to everyone who participated in this election!

Next year's election will be based on cohort `B`, which includes Miriam Pena, Peer Stritzinger, Sophie DeBenedetto, and Bryan Paxton, and will represent yet another opportunity to get involved in the BEAM ecosystem.
