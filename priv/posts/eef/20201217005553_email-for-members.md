The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is pleased to announce its new email for members program.

We highly value the community and support of our members and wish to show our appreciation with this new program.

## How many aliases or accounts can I have?

 This is an excellent question! Each member is entitled to either one alias or one account.

## How do I opt in?

 - Login to this site using your member credentials.
 - Visit your member profile either by clicking in on your name in the upper right hand corner
   of the site and then clicking "Profile" or just follow this [link](/members/profile).
 - If you qualify, you will see a message with a link to a form, click it.
 - In the form you may select email alias or account.
    - An alias will simply forward to the email address you have set in your member profile.
    - An account is a mail account you will have to login to or set up in a mail client.

    - All email address requests are subject to review.
    - We recommend using `firstname.lastname` or some similar variation.

  possible. After such you shall receive a confirmation email.
