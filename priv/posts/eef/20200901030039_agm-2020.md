## Quorum Requirements
Our Bylaws Section 3.9 require a quorum of 1/3 (one third) of the eligible voting members to be present for a meeting to be deemed quorate.
Since:
1. Covid-19 restrictions prohibit an in-person AGM, and
2. Global distribution of the members make real-time synchronization due to time-zone awkward,

the board decided per Section 3.1 to hold the AGM electronically. In order to comply with the three subsections of Section 3.1 that require authentication of the voting members and allowing members reasonable access to the content, we will be holding the actual voting via the Wild Apricot Members portal (authentication) and two Zoom Conferences (content access) as a mechanism of interactive feedback and Q&A.

**Note:** since the AGM is electronic and virtual, Section 14.8 Electronic Voting rules apply.
Proposed AGM Process
1. Electronic voting will open on September 11th.
2. No specific provision will be made for proxy voting, since voting is electronic and will take place over several days.
3. The two Zoom calls will go through the AGM content.
4. The content of the AGM will also be posted online.
5. Voting members are not required to attend either of the Zoom calls but are encouraged to review the meeting content in some way before voting.
6. All voting members of record as of September 10th are entitled and encouraged to vote.
7. The AGM voting will be open for the 14 days period after the AGM date of September 11th.

## General Purpose of any AGM
1. Elect or affirm the board of directors.
2. Receive information about the past year's activities, progress, achievements and milestones.
