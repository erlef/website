# Meet the Sponsors - AppSignal

*Welcome to **Meet the Sponsors**, a section in which you will find the profiles of our sponsors. Here you will learn about them and why they decide to support this great community. Today we will get to know AppSignal. Enjoy it!*

AppSignal emerged from an agency that loved and worked with Ruby and Rails since 2005. What initially began as a side project is now one of the leading monitoring services for teams using Ruby. 

In 2016, AppSignal observed the emergence of a new language, and they felt as excited as they did in 2005. At the time, no one else had built a consolidated exception tracking and performance monitoring platform for Elixir. 

Some competitors encouraged developers to build applications using their SDK, resulting in an open-source project lacking official support. Despite already possessing a fully-featured product for Ruby applications, they recognized the potential in a new platform and made the strategic decision to develop AppSignal for Elixir.

On this journey, they partnered with Arjan Scherpenisse, an Erlang expert with more than 17 years of experience, who helped them with their proof of concept. With this solid foundation in place, their team built upon it, incorporating invaluable feedback from dozens of beta users who expressed their excitement for AppSignal.

Fast-forward seven years, and they remain one of the primary providers of APM for Erlang and Elixir. Over this period, they have introduced an automated dashboard to keep track of Erlang VM metrics and added support for Ecto, Finch, Oban, Phoenix, Plug, and others. They provide error tracking, performance monitoring, host monitoring, anomaly detection, uptime monitoring, public status pages, custom metric dashboards, logging, and more.

AppSignal is bootstrapped and the only 100% European APM in terms of ownership and data storage location. They are ISO27001 certified and GDPR and HIPAA compliant.

#### About sponsoring the foundation

AppSignal decided to support our organization to reciprocate the warm embrace they have received from the community since embarking on their journey with Elixir.

Their introduction to our foundation came through Sophie DeBenedetto, a valued member of our community who serves as a writer and editor for their [blog and Elixir Alchemy newsletter](https://blog.appsignal.com/category/elixir.html)

Excited about the opportunity to engage with our foundation, particularly with Erlang and Elixir users worldwide, AppSignal aims to play a pivotal role in advancing the adoption of related open-source software. 

#### A little more about AppSignal

The company was founded in 2012 by Roy Tomeij, Thijs Cadier, and Wes Oudshoorn, who are all primarily known for their work within the Ruby community. As a fully remote company, AppSignal has a diverse team with members based in the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Pakistan, Latvia, and Greece.

Their commitment to community growth is evident through their sponsorship of the Elixir Forum, Elixir Radar, various podcasts, and numerous events. Through these initiatives, they actively contribute to the enrichment of the community.
