Welcome to meet the sponsors, a section in which you will find the profiles of our sponsors. Here you will learn about them and why they decided to support our great community!

# DNSimple
Founded in 2010
Using the BEAM since 2012

Job board: https://dnsimple.com/jobs

# About the company
DNSimple provides a comprehensive API and web interface for domain management automation to customers around the world. Our vision is one where anyone, regardless of skill level, can register domains and connect them to the services we love without thinking about DNS.

DNSimple is based in Melbourne, Florida and we have team members from a wide variety of locations around the world, including North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Moreover, we've been fully remote since the beginning of the company.

# Why Erlang?
When transitioning from an existing open source name server written in C++, we investigated several possible languages for their implementation, and Erlang was the best fit for their needs.

At present, our authoritative name server infrastructure is written in Erlang. Furthermore, we provide an Elixir open-source client for our API.

# Why are you sponsoring?
DNSimple relies on Erlang for its name server infrastructure. We believe in the value of a strong and sustainable Erlang community and believe that one way we can support the community is by being a corporate sponsor of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation. That’s why we plan on continuing to support the foundation financially.

# What do you think the Foundation’s best achievement to date is?
We think the Foundation's best achievement to date would be the contributions to the Open Telemetry implementation in Erlang, which have already proven valuable.

# What are areas you would like to see the foundation focus on?
We hope the foundation will continue to focus on tooling around Erlang and the BEAM to ensure it remains a strong technology for future use.
