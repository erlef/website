# About the company
DNSimple provides a comprehensive API and web interface for domain management automation to customers around the world. Their vision is one where anyone, regardless of skill level, can register domains and connect them to the services they love without thinking about DNS.

DNSimple is based in Melbourne, Florida, and they have team members from a wide variety of locations around the world, including North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Moreover, they've been fully remote since the beginning of the company.

# Why Erlang?
When transitioning from an existing open source name server written in C++, they investigated several possible languages for their implementation, and Erlang was the best fit for their needs.

At present, their authoritative name server infrastructure is written in Erlang. Furthermore, 
they provide an Elixir open-source client for their API.

# Why sponsor the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation?
DNSimple relies on Erlang for its name server infrastructure. 

They believe in the value of a strong and sustainable Erlang community and believe that one way they can support the community is by being a corporate sponsor of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation. That’s why they plan on continuing to support the foundation financially.

# The foundation’s best achievement to date
They think the foundation's best achievement to date would be the contributions to the Open Telemetry implementation in Erlang, which have already proven valuable.

# Areas they would like to see the foundation focus on
They hope the foundation will continue to focus on tooling around Erlang and the BEAM to 
ensure it remains a strong technology for future use.
