DNSimple provides a comprehensive API and web interface for domain management automation to customers around the world. Their vision is one where anyone, regardless of skill level, can register domains and connect them to the services they love without thinking about DNS.

They started using the BEAM in 2012: When transitioning from an existing open source name server written in C++, they investigated several possible languages for their implementation, and Erlang was the best fit for their needs. At present, their authoritative name server infrastructure is written in Erlang. Furthermore, they provide an Elixir open-source client for their API.

# About sponsoring the foundation

DNSimple decided to support our organization because they rely on Erlang for its name server infrastructure. They believe in the value of a strong and sustainable Erlang community and believe that one way they can support the community is by being a corporate sponsor of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation.

They think the Foundation's best achievement to date would be the contributions to the Open Telemetry implementation in Erlang, which have already proven valuable, and hope the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation will continue to focus on tooling around Erlang and the BEAM to ensure it remains a strong technology for future use.
