The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is excited to support the launch of Rebar4 on Kickstarter. As the next evolution of one of the BEAM’s most important tools, Rebar4 will bring tighter integration with Erlang/OTP, unified support for Erlang, Elixir, and other BEAM languages, and a smoother onboarding experience for developers. The campaign is live now — help shape the future of the ecosystem by backing it today.

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is proud to have supported the launch of the Rebar4 project on Kickstarter. Rebar has been a cornerstone tool for the Erlang/OTP ecosystem for years, and this new version will ensure seamless integration with OTP going forward.

The campaign is already underway — but it needs more backers to reach its goal.

Rebar4’s tighter integration with Erlang/OTP will provide significant benefits:

- A unified tool for Erlang, Elixir, and other BEAM languages, bundled into a single, official package.
- Out-of-the-box compatibility with mixed projects, enabling developers to seamlessly switch between Erlang, Elixir, LFE, and Luerl in the same environment.
- Simplified onboarding for new users, making Rebar4 more accessible and welcoming, especially for Elixir developers.

> “Rebar4 will also be ready to be integrated into future versions of Erlang/OTP and even be able to replace the current makefiles used to build Erlang/OTP.  This will result in substantially faster builds and Erlang/OTP will come with batteries included and contain its own build tool.”
