# Support Rebar4 on Kickstarter

The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation is proud to have supported the launch of the Rebar4 project on Kickstarter. Rebar has been a cornerstone tool for the Erlang/OTP ecosystem for years, and this new version will ensure seamless integration with OTP going forward.

The campaign is already underway — but it needs more backers to reach its goal.

Rebar4’s tighter integration with Erlang/OTP will provide significant benefits:

- A unified tool for Erlang, Elixir, and other BEAM languages, bundled into a single, official package.
- Out-of-the-box compatibility with mixed projects, enabling developers to seamlessly switch between Erlang, Elixir, LFE, and Luerl in the same environment.
- Simplified onboarding for new users, making Rebar4 more accessible and welcoming, especially for Elixir developers.

> “Rebar4 will also be ready to be integrated into future versions of Erlang/OTP and even be able to replace the current makefiles used to build Erlang/OTP.  This will result in substantially faster builds and Erlang/OTP will come with batteries included and contain its own build tool.”
