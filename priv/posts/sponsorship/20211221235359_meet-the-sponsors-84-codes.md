CloudAMQP is a service hosted by the company 84codes AB, which is a Swedish tech company dedicated to simplifying cloud 
infrastructure for developers. They provide a set of high-quality cloud-hosted open source 
services: CloudAMQP, CloudKarafka, ElephantSQL, and CloudMQTT. By doing so, they are helping thousands of companies 
to build distributed systems that process millions of messages per second and to build IoT services that have 
millions of devices pushing sensor data over the Internet. 

But above all, they help developers to focus on building new applications and not having to spend time on 
managing their specialized servers.

84codes uses Erlang (and some Elixir) in CloudAMQP, which is a managed RabbitMQ service. They have over 5000 servers runnng Erlang.


# About sponsoring the foundation

They decided it was time to deepen their integration into the Erlang ecosystem and help shepherd into the future in a 
long-term fashion. They hope to see the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation focusing on the stability of the Erlang VM, and, 
in the short term, they look forward to seeing JIT for ARM.

# A little more about 84codes

All CloudAMQP team members work remotely, which has always been the 84codes way of running the company since the 
beginning, in 2012. They have the freedom to choose where they want to work, as well as their hours.
The team is scattered around Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States, and they get together four times a year 
in different locations to work together in what they call 'workaways'.
