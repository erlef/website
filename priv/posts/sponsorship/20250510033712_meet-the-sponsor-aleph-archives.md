#### Why the BEAM

Dr. Younès Hafri, Aleph Archives founder, discovered Erlang during the summer of 1999, shortly after its release as open source software. What began as personal projects quickly evolved into professional development work, leading to a deep appreciation for the platform's capabilities. This extensive experience with the BEAM has been foundational to its company technical architecture and success.

Aleph Archives has built its entire Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform on Erlang/OTP technology. Their architecture combines cutting-edge compression techniques with robust data integrity verification, leveraging Erlang/OTP's proven capabilities in building fault-tolerant systems. This technology choice has enabled them to deliver exceptional stability and reliability that has earned the trust of clients worldwide.

#### About sponsoring the foundation

As a company built on Erlang/OTP, Aleph Archives decided to sponsor our foundation to support the ecosystem that powers their success. They believe the Foundation's work is vital for the continued growth and innovation of BEAM technologies, and they want to contribute to this shared future:

***“By becoming a corporate sponsor, we aim to contribute to the sustainable development of the technologies we rely on while actively participating in shaping the future of the BEAM ecosystem. Our sponsorship reflects our commitment to giving back to the community that has been instrumental in our growth”.***

They highlight the Foundation’s success in unifying the BEAM ecosystem under a shared vision while maintaining the technology's high standards. By establishing working groups, coordinating community efforts, and fostering collaboration between different stakeholders, they believe the Foundation has created a more cohesive and sustainable environment for Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, and related technologies:

***“This structured approach to ecosystem development ensures that these technologies remain robust and relevant for mission-critical applications like our own”.***

As sponsors, Aleph Archives also wants to contribute to making the BEAM even faster:

***“While Erlang wasn't originally designed for data crunching missions, the recent addition of JIT compilation to the BEAM has demonstrated significant potential for performance improvements”.***

They see many unexplored opportunities to enhance the platform’s capabilities. Given their work in data archiving and processing, they are particularly interested in seeing how these performance optimizations could further improve our ability to handle large-scale data operations efficiently
