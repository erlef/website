Founded in 2022, **CalmWave** is on a mission to improve healthcare by eliminating non-actionable alarms in hospitals. Alarm fatigue—caused by the overwhelming number of unnecessary alerts—creates stress for both clinicians and patients, affecting staff retention and patient outcomes.

With its **Transparent AI**, CalmWave provides clear, data-driven insights, empowering a hospital’s nursing staff to evaluate and implement optimized alarm limit recommendations in the bedside monitor of patient's rooms. The **CalmWave Operations Platform** seamlessly integrates with hospital EMRs. By addressing alarm fatigue, CalmWave improves patient outcomes and workplace conditions for medical professionals.

#### Why the BEAM

Erlang supports an incredible language/runtime that is a superb core for their ingestion and enrichment of mission-critical high-volume / high-frequency ICU data. This allows them to objectively and relentlessly improve healthcare, starting with eliminating non-actionable and incessant ICU alarms.

Their team is fully distributed around the world, with primary headquarters in Seattle.
