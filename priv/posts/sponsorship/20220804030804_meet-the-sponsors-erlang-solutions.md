Erlang Solutions build, maintain and improve reliable, fault-tolerant and massively scalable distributed systems using the BEAM for the world’s most ambitious companies. They focus on their three core pillars of in-depth technical capabilities, results-focused consultancy and a deep connection to the community to help their team, customers and the community grow successfully.

# Since the beginning

Francesco Cesarini, Founder and Technical Director of the Erlang Solutions, started working as an intern at Ericsson's computer science laboratory, where Erlang was invented. He was involved with the R1 release of OTP, using it on Ericsson’s fixed and mobile broadband solutions. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source he founded Erlang Solutions to help more companies benefit from the out-the-box fault-tolerance and resilience of Erlang and the BEAM VM.

At Erlang Solutions, specialist consultants work on production systems with startups and the world's largest companies alike. They provide a variety of services from training and support to consultancy, prototyping and development. As a result, they work on a massive array of solutions, solving complex problems for leaders in industries such as fintech, healthcare, energy, social media and many more.

# About sponsoring the foundation

Erlang Solutions sees in the Foundation the best fit tool for many of modern computing's most common needs. They believed that as the Ecosystem grows with new killer applications, programming languages, frameworks and libraries, there is a great opportunity to further the adoption, increase developer happiness and really grow the use of Erlang-based technologies. Therefore, this situation will mean more reliable systems, less energy and physical infrastructure and a better computing environment.

The Erlang Solutions team has had a special role in the Embedded, Build and Packaging and Observability workgroups; chair the Sponsorship and Fellowship workgroups and sit on the board. Although they do so as private individuals, on behalf of the community, when necessary, they can pull the strings within Erlang Solutions, allowing the company to help where needed.

They highlight the excellent work being done by the working groups such as: the Security workgroup’s Secure Coding and Deployment Hardening Guidelines and all the contributions of the Build and Packaging workgroup. And a special mention is made to the Embedded and Machine learning workgroups, for bringing together a diverse community of people with common interests.

# Working together

Erlang Solutions share the foundation's passion for making the community a diverse and inclusive place. That is why they even partner to provide diversity spaces for a number of our conferences. As a result, 100's of young developers have been able to attend the conferences, learn and meet some of the most experienced developers in the community.

They believe that the diversity and inclusion tickets are one of the foundation’s best achievements because it allows users to attend conferences and training in person. Along those same lines, they show great support for the scholarships the Foundation has given for a wide range of tools, libraries and applications.

They would like the foundation to continue raising funds and giving them in the form of grants to the community to promote the ecosystem, help it grow and prosper. They are convinced that this will allow the tools to be top-notch, the BEAM to be secure, and to focus on areas that might not be relevant or important to Ericsson.

As part of the community, they would like to see a thriving space in the Erlang ecosystem, so they are happy to partner in most initiatives that make this happen. They also want the foundation to take over their binary packages, to get more information from the community.
