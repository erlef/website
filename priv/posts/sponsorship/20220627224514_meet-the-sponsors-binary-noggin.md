Binary Noggin is a group of dedicated engineers that create customizable solutions. They believe that working in groups is the key to success. As a sample of that, they have great experience in pair programming and testing.

# Why the BEAM

Binary Noggin has been developing software using the BEAM since 2017. The journey began when Amos King, its founder, was working on a secure chat software that was originally written in Java and needed more effective methods and tools.Therefore, they
decided to move the server to Erlang.

In Joe Armstrong's book, Amos found the scalability, speed, simplicity, and resiliency of the new server code. This ignited a passion to learn more about Erlang and the BEAM.

# About sponsoring the foundation

Binary Noggin highlights the importance of spreading the word about the power of the BEAM to support the languages, projects, and the community around it, and thatâ€™s why they decided to support our organization. They want to give back to the BEAM community and to get to know their projects as well. That is also why Amos King is the host of [Elixir Outlaws](https://elixiroutlaws.com/), a place to debate about interesting things happening in Elixir.

They would like the whole community to see the support that the foundation provides to open source developers in the BEAM. They believe that having a growing community is the key to continue in this journey.

# A little more about Binary Noggin

Binary Noggin was founded in 2007 by Amos King. He is also the owner of Elixir Outlaw. Amos lives in Kansas City and would love to share street tacos with anyone from the community who comes to town!
