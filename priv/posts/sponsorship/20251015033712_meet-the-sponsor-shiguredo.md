Founded in 2013 and based in Tokyo, Japan, **Shiguredo Inc.** builds WebRTC-based server software for real-time audio, video, and data. Their solutions power interactive meetings, large-scale broadcasts, and low-latency streaming experiences.

Their flagship product, Sora, is implemented entirely in Erlang/OTP, enabling them to deliver reliable and scalable infrastructure for real-time communication.

#### Why the BEAM

Shiguredo’s founder began his journey with Erlang/OTP around 2006, while looking for the right technology to build mission-critical systems that could scale efficiently on multi-core hardware. Since then, Erlang/OTP has been at the core of their technical architecture.

Sora is implemented purely in Erlang/OTP —with no NIFs— to maximize stability. Shiguredo leverages Erlang distribution together with the ra (Raft) library and Plumtree to deliver scale-out clustering.

#### About sponsoring the foundation

Having built with Erlang/OTP for nearly two decades, Shiguredo is committed to continue relying on this technology in the years ahead. Sponsoring the Foundation is their way of supporting the tools and community that power their success.

They highlight two achievements of the Foundation as especially impactful: the Maintenance of rebar3 and long-term sponsorship of AsmJit, which underpins performance-critical native code generation used in multimedia and systems Contexts. 

Shiguredo would like to see continued investment from the Foundation in both rebar3 and AsmJit, ensuring these essential projects remain sustainable and evolving.

*Our foundation is supported by the funding of our sponsors, and it is what allows us to carry out projects, marketing initiatives, stipends programs, and accomplish the goals that we have established as an organization. So if you are interested in becoming a sponsor, contact us at [sponsorship@erlef.org](mailto:sponsorship@erlef.org). We look forward to hearing from you!*
