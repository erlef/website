# Meet the Sponsors - Ti Tokyo

Welcome to Meet the Sponsors, a section in which you will find the profiles of our sponsors. Here you will learn about them and why they decide to support this great community. Today we will get to know TI Tokyo. Enjoy it!

TI Tokyo is an English IT company based in Japan. Initially founded as a training company, it transitioned into IT support at the request of its customers. Over time, it became the world’s leading provider of Enterprise-Grade, SLA-backed Riak support

#### Why the BEAM

Their first encounter with Erlang and the BEAM was, as they described, rather unexpected. Basho, the original creator of Riak, was seeking an English-speaking partner to provide APAC support, and they were chosen for the role.

They were introduced to Erlang and the BEAM through their OpenRiak/Riak support service. Since 2017, they have played a larger role in the Riak community by providing packaging, documentation and free support to the community. 

Additionally, they have modernized Riak CS and TS by developing new features. They also provide in-house development services for their clients, such as backporting Riak patches or providing custom-builds for niche use-cases. They also use Erlang for developing our own product lines.

#### About sponsoring the foundation

They decided to become a sponsor and support our community because they believe Erlang and the BEAM have contributed so much to their company through Riak/OpenRiak. As they put it: “It seemed only fair to give something back, with the hope that this could inspire other engineers and developers who have not been as fortunate as ourselves.”

The foundation has played a significant role in making it easier for the company to promote and coordinate initiatives, particularly through their involvement in founding OpenRiak alongside other key contributors and companies. Rebranding as OpenRiak finally allowed the community to move away the large amounts of obsolete Riak related web content that still dominates search results.

They are very pleased with their current exchanges with the foundation and are eager to explore more ways for people to collaborate.

#### A little more about Ti Tokyo

The company was founded in 2014, and they are officially based in Tokyo. However, their employees are spread around the world to help them implement their follow-the-sun support. They have people in Japan, UK, Ukraine and the USA allowing us to provide 24/7 coverage for their clients.
