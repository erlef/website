NineFX provides services and software to commercial and US government customers. Its specialty is mission-critical messaging systems with stringent security requirements.

Their first contact with Erlang was when they came across a copy of Joe Armstrongâ€™s book while their founder was deployed to the Middle East with the Army. At present, they use it in multiple solutions for their customers.
They are also looking at Gleam as a strongly-typed option for the BEAM.


# About sponsoring the foundation

NineFX decided to support our organization to keep strong formal and informal ties to the Erlang community. Also, they believe that it keeps them connected with other industrial users who depend on the BEAM for their core business. This allows them to hear what works and doesn't at scale, which is of great value to them.
Moreover, they are an active part of the Security working group, so they plan to continue engaging with the foundation in this way, with the desire to return to face-to-face conferences again after COVID-19.

They would like to see the foundation sponsor work on development projects that benefit the community as a whole.

# A little more about NineFX

The company was founded in 2009 and is based in Columbia, South Carolina, and most of its employees work there.
