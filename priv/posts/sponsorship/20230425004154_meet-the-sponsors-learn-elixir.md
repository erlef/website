Learn Elixir provides all kinds of opportunities to learn this programming language, its mission is to become the gold standard of education within the Elixir community through their curriculum, weekly live training sessions, assistant teachers of IA, project assignments, code reviews, opportunity preparation and placement.

Mika, Learn Elixir cofounder, was first learning how to code and went to a Ruby on Rails bootcamp, so he could find a job. One of the TAâ€™s told him Elixir had a similar syntax to Ruby, but was a functional and concurrent language for building highly scalable applications. The ecosystem also provided  a similar webframework to Rails called Phoenix, so he jumped on it and started making small production systems at the first startup he worked for.

Aside from building their site, their main use of Elixir is teaching the language. This year they also have plans to create an AI driven LMS to host their offering. In addition, Mika also contributes to the community through [GitHub](https://github.com/MikaAK).
